A image compaison program that my GF asked for, thus the name.

It compares the first image to the next then if its the same delelets the duplicate, then when it finds a new image it renames original "_X(number of deleted Images)" the new image then becomes the comparison image.

I have also added the abbility to remove parts of a file name.

My first big(ish) project and im continuing to improve and add more features over time.
